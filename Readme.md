## The Problem

It's well-known that more than a half of the Software Projects overruns its initial estimations. This problem is usually not all about the development process but sometime we play a role in this.

We are responsable to estimate the technical activity that take place to complete a Software project. This activity is challenging and sometime frightening mainly due the following reasons:

- An estimation is by definition probabilistic -- Business views estimations as something done by a certain date.
- Our reputation is at stake.
- There is a big variability on some tasks, some of them are not under our control (dependencies), or simply we are not confident on something.

Also, more often than not, we have to meet tight deadlines "strongly recommended" by the management, receiving lots of pressure to get things done. The best approach to deal with them is to produce accurate estimations and communicate effectively all the possible risk we see applying that due date.

The most convenient way to do that in our opinion is to provide a probabilistic prospect that shows the likelihood to meet a certain due date.

*An estimation is not a number, an estimation is a distribution*

## Our Solution

Our tool provides a super easy and fast way to produce accurate and detailed estimations, with probability distribution suitable for managers to make their appropriate plans.

Everything you have to do is provide three numbers (*trivalent analysis*)

- Optimistic estimate: everything goes right, this must be more likely than Pessimistic.
- Normal Estimate: that one with greatest chances of success.
- Pessimistic Estimate: widely pessimistic.

The Rest is ADE's work!ðŸ˜ˆ
